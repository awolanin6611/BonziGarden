    <p>I am a 6th generation Bonsai molder. Shortly after the Californian Gold Rush, my Great-Great Grandfather decided to bring our beloved tradition from our ancestrial home of Japan to the ever growing United States. Now over 100 years later, we ship our trees to over 150 countries. Spreading peace and tranquility across the globe.</p>
